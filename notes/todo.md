## Agent Failure Scenarios (Manual QA)
identify at least 3 different scenarios where the agent or the Agentic UX flow might fail, behave
unexpectedly, or result in a poor user experience.
For each scenario:
* Describe the scenario or user action
* Explain how you would test it manually
* If possible, actually try to test it in the product and share what happened
* Describe what you would expect the correct behavior to be
We’re not looking for perfect answers — we care about your thinking process, investigation, and observations.

## Exploratory Testing (Encouraged)
Spend some time freely exploring the product.
You don’t need to automate this part.
Please be ready to talk about:
* What you explored and why
* Anything confusing, surprising, broken, or unclear
* What you chose to test first
* What you would want to test next if you joined the team
Curiosity and initiative are a big plus here.

## Presentation
After completing the assignment, you’ll be asked to present your work to the team.
Please be ready to walk us through:
* Your overall testing approach
* Project setup and structure
* Key automation decisions (selectors, waits, validations)
* How you used AI during development
* Your manual testing scenarios and findings
* What you’d improve or expand if you had more time
No slides are required — screen sharing your code and notes is perfect.
